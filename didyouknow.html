const FACTS = [
  { title: "The word 'statistics' comes from politics.", body: "It originates from the Latin word status, meaning state. Early statistics was literally about governing." },

  { title: "Florence Nightingale was a statistician.", body: "She used data visualization to convince the British government to reform military hospitals." },

  { title: "The average person has more than the average number of friends.", body: "It’s called the friendship paradox. Your friends are likely more connected than you are." },

  { title: "Abraham Wald saved planes by ignoring bullet holes.", body: "He realized you should reinforce the places that weren’t hit. Survivorship bias in action." },

  { title: "A single p-value does not measure truth.", body: "It only measures how surprising your data would be if a specific assumption were true." },

  { title: "Randomness looks less random than you think.", body: "Humans expect patterns even in truly random sequences. That is why coin flips feel suspicious." },

  { title: "The normal distribution was once controversial.", body: "Not everyone believed errors should form a bell curve. It took decades to become standard." },

  { title: "Most people misunderstand averages.", body: "The mean, median, and mode answer very different questions." },

  { title: "Simpson’s paradox can reverse conclusions.", body: "A trend that appears in separate groups can disappear or reverse when groups are combined." },

  { title: "Regression to the mean explains many miracles.", body: "Extremely good or bad performances tend to move closer to average next time." },

  { title: "The birthday paradox surprises most people.", body: "In a group of just 23 people, there is over a 50 percent chance two share a birthday." },

  { title: "Correlation has fooled smart people for centuries.", body: "Ice cream sales and shark attacks both rise in summer. Temperature is the hidden variable." },

  { title: "Data visualization can change policy.", body: "Clear charts have historically influenced governments more than long reports." },

  { title: "Small samples lie more loudly.", body: "The smaller the sample, the more dramatic the fluctuations." },

  { title: "Bayesian statistics updates beliefs.", body: "Instead of fixed conclusions, it adjusts probabilities as new evidence arrives." },

  { title: "Most published findings are exaggerated.", body: "Effect sizes often shrink when studies are replicated." },

  { title: "Machine learning is statistics with better marketing.", body: "Under the hood, many ML methods are classical statistical ideas." },

  { title: "The law of large numbers is patient.", body: "Random fluctuations shrink only when the sample size grows sufficiently." },

  { title: "Outliers can be stories.", body: "Sometimes they are errors. Sometimes they are the most important observations." },

  { title: "Confidence intervals are often misunderstood.", body: "They do not mean there is a 95 percent chance the parameter lies in the interval." },

  { title: "The placebo effect is measurable.", body: "Belief alone can produce statistically significant changes." },

  { title: "Big data does not mean good data.", body: "Bias scales too." },

  { title: "Graphs can lie without changing numbers.", body: "Axes, scaling, and truncation can distort perception dramatically." },

  { title: "The first census was about taxes.", body: "Counting people has long been tied to governance and resources." },

  { title: "Randomized trials were once radical.", body: "The idea of random assignment in medicine faced resistance early on." },

  { title: "Most models are wrong.", body: "Some are useful. That is the actual quote." },

  { title: "Standard deviation measures spread, not uncertainty.", body: "It describes variation within data, not the precision of your estimate." },

  { title: "AI still relies on probability.", body: "Behind the scenes, it is mostly structured uncertainty." },

  { title: "Humans are terrible at estimating risk.", body: "We fear rare dramatic events and ignore common silent ones." },

  { title: "Data cleaning takes most of the time.", body: "The glamorous part is modeling. The real work is preparation." },

  { title: "A single number rarely tells the whole story.", body: "Context is the hidden variable in almost everything." }
