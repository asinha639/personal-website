        <h1>Where I come from, and what stayed with me</h1>
        <p class="lede">
          This is the part of my life that shows up quietly in everything I do, in how I learn, how I work,
          how I show up for people, and how I try to keep myself grounded.

      <section class="prose">
        <p>
          I was born in Kolkata, a city that never really whispers. It argues, sings, negotiates, celebrates,
          and then somehow finds room for tenderness in between all the noise. Some of my earliest memories feel
          like a collage of narrow lanes, evening light, and the kind of family warmth that makes even ordinary
          days feel like an occasion.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then in sixth grade, my world shifted. I moved to Santiniketan. If Kolkata was a pulse, Santiniketan was
          a breath. The air felt wider. The sky felt closer. Days had space in them. And suddenly learning was not
          only about classrooms and exams, it was about noticing. Noticing seasons, noticing people, noticing how
          the mind behaves when it is not rushed.
        </p>

        <p>
          I studied at Patha Bhavana at Visva Bharati, and later did both my bachelor’s and master’s there too.
          In many ways, that place did not just educate me, it shaped my temperament. It made learning feel like a
          way of living. You grew up in the lap of mother nature, and you learned that knowledge does not have to
          be boxed into a syllabus. It can be carried in your hands through crafts, in your body through sport,
          and in your eyes through the everyday discipline of paying attention.
        </p>

        <p class="quote">
          “The highest education is that which does not merely give us information but makes our life in harmony with all existence.”
        </p>

        <p>
          That line from Rabindranath Tagore has always stayed close to me because it describes what I felt before I
          could even name it. Education, at its best, is not a transaction. It is alignment. You learn, and you become
          a little more whole. You become a little more honest with yourself. You start understanding that discipline is
          not punishment, it is a form of care.
        </p>

        <p>
          Santiniketan gave me that kind of grounding. It gave me mornings where the world felt unreasonably calm, and
          afternoons where you could be tired in the best way, from being outside, from playing, from building something,
          from trying again after failing at it. Crafts were not an extra. Sports were not a distraction. They were part
          of how you became a person.
        </p>

        <p class="quote">
          “Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high.”
        </p>

        <p>
          I do not read that line as something only political. To me it is personal. It is about building a mind that can
          stand tall, not because it is loud, but because it is clear. A mind that can question, learn, and also be humble
          enough to keep changing. That idea, that the inner posture matters, has followed me into every chapter after.
        </p>

        <p>
          Soccer is one of the best parts of my life. It is hard to explain the kind of joy that lives in a good match day.
          The field, the rhythm, the small moments of teamwork, the feeling that your body and your mind are speaking the
          same language for a while. I love playing, I love watching, and yes, Manchester United has my heart.
        </p>

        <p>
          What I love most about soccer is that it teaches you how to belong. You learn how to lead without dominating,
          how to work without needing credit, how to stay calm when the game turns against you. It is also where I have
          some of my happiest memories, the kind that do not need photos to feel vivid.
        </p>

        <p>
          I genuinely believe sports should be an integral part of everyone’s life. Not as a hobby that you do when you
          get time, but as a steady practice. It keeps you honest. It keeps you resilient. It gives you energy, and it
          teaches you how to lose without falling apart. In Santiniketan, that was not an argument, it was normal life.
          And that is how Tagore envisioned it too, education that respects the mind and the body together.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of work and sport, cooking is where I unwind and where I get to be playful. My wife is a great cook,
          and we genuinely love experimenting together. Our kitchen turns into this small lab of flavors, Indian, Bengali,
          and Southern influences showing up in unexpected combinations. Some nights it is a proper plan, and some nights
          it is just curiosity. A little of this, a little of that, taste, adjust, laugh, and try again.
        </p>

        <p class="quote">
          “I slept and dreamt that life was joy. I awoke and saw that life was service. I acted and behold, service was joy.”
        </p>

        <p>
          I do not bring that quote up to sound philosophical. I bring it up because I have felt it, in small ways, over
          time. In teaching, in collaboration, in showing up for family, in being present in the ordinary parts of life.
          Even cooking feels like that sometimes. You feed people you love, and the act itself becomes the joy.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I look back, the line from Kolkata to Santiniketan is not just geography for me. It is a kind of internal map.
          It reminds me that ambition and calm do not have to be enemies. That rigor can live with softness. That learning is
          not a phase you finish, it is a way you stay awake.
        </p>

        <p>
          And if I had to describe what stayed with me the most, it would be this. I want my work to be precise, but I also
          want my life to be in harmony. With people. With the world around me. With the values I grew up breathing in, under
          open skies.
        </p>

  There is another chapter that shaped me just as deeply, and that one begins with my grandmother. After high school, she would tell me again and again that I must do a PhD. It was never about the title for her. Her reasoning was simple and powerful. A PhD, she would say, is your way of giving back to the subject you have been learning. It is your contribution. It is a moral responsibility.
</p>

<p>
  At first, I listened politely. Over time, I began to take it seriously. I had studied statistics for both my bachelor’s and master’s degrees. I loved the structure of it, the clarity, the elegance of a well framed problem. But I also knew I wanted to see it breathe in the real world. I wanted an applied field. Biostatistics felt like the natural choice. It had rigor, but it also had consequence.
</p>

<p>
  And that decision brought me to Augusta.
</p>

<p>
  Augusta is not loud. It is a small university town in the South, steady and unpretentious. The kind of place that is perfect for school life. You can focus. You can grow. You can quietly build something meaningful. Moving to a new country on my own was not simple. There were days of doubt, moments of homesickness, and a constant hum of adjustment. But there was also excitement. Independence. Discovery.
</p>

<p>
  I found friends here who changed my world. The kind of friendships that shape how you think, how you laugh, how you handle difficulty. Augusta gave me more than a degree. It gave me perspective.
</p>

<p>
  It also gave me my wife.
</p>

<p>
  We met here during school, two people trying to figure out research, deadlines, and life in a new way. Somewhere between classes, conversations, and long evenings of shared ambition, something steady began to grow. Today, we have two beautiful young ones running around the house. Life looks very different now. Fuller. Louder. Softer in the right places.
</p>

<p>
  Sometimes I think about my grandmother and her insistence. About how a simple sentence repeated with conviction can redirect a life. The PhD was not just a degree. It became what she said it would be. A contribution. A responsibility. A way of giving back to a subject that has given me so much.
</p>

<p>
  From the red soil of Santiniketan to the quiet streets of Augusta, the journey has stretched across continents. But the thread is the same. Learn deeply. Stay grounded. Contribute honestly. And keep building a life that feels aligned.
